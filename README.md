Project Description
This project is a responsive card slider component developed using JavaScript, API, and local storage. It is designed to display dynamic content such as recommended or similar products.

Features
API Integration – Fetches product data from an API and dynamically displays it.
Local Storage Support – Stores fetched data locally to enhance performance and reduce redundant API calls.
Responsive Design – Adapts seamlessly to different devices and screen sizes.
Easy Integration – Simply add the component to a <div> with the class product-detail, and it will automatically work.
Usage
The included index.html file serves as a reference for integrating the component. However, all functionality is handled within the JavaScript file. Ensure that the script is added to the relevant page for the slider to function properly.
